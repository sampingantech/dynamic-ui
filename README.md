# dynamic-ui
A dynamic-ui library to generate view based on JSON Schema draft 07

# How to test locally
1. git clone this repo (remember its cloned path)
1. In the Android Studio, Click `New` -> `Import Module` (pointing to cloned path in no. 1)
1. Change gradle to `implementation(project(':dynamic-ui'))`
1. Voila, you can test it locally and make changes as well
1. Please make sure not to include this library on your repository, better to add it as a git submodule (but this is for advanced git user)

# I want to contribute/bugfix/refactor
1. git clone of course
1. git add submodule
1. make changes inside `:dyanmic-ui` and push it to github as separate repository from your main repo
